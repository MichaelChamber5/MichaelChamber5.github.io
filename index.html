      <h2 class = "specialHeader">A Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;My name is Michael Chambers. I am a undergrad software engineer currently getting my 
        bachelor's of science in computer science at <a href="https://www.gcc.edu">Grove City College</a>.
        I am also currently in the process of minoring in both video game design and artificial intelligence.
        This website serves as a portfolio to show off some of my projects.

      <h2 class = "specialHeader">Some of my Projects:</h2>
      <h2><a href = "AsteroidsWebBuild/asteroids.html">Asteroids 3D!</a></h2>
      <p>
        This project was made in unity using C#.
        I'm pretty proud of this one (made in less than 48 hours!). I think the core mechanic of
        flying through space and shooting asteroids is pretty fun. I've been told the controls
        are challenging, but I argue that realistic flight controls are more fun. I had to implement
        some interesting coding tricks to make the game playable without good gaming hardware.
        I used an object pool to store the asteroids (rather than contuously instantiating and
        deleting). I also created a spawning buble around the player with an external despawning
        bubble. This essentially makes the game infinite, allowing the player to fly as far as
        they want in any direction, spawning in new asteroids and removing asteroids that are 
        far out of range.

      <h2><a href = "index.html">Bombies</a></h2>
      <p>
        This project was made in unity using C#.
        This was a homework project made for my 3D games class. It's unfinished (as of now). I
        think the gameplay is still polished/fun enough to show off regardless. If I had the time,
        I would add player and zombie models to make the game... actually have zombies. I would
        also work on making a nicer looking menu system. Other than that, the game is at a decent
        state.
      </p>
      <h2><a href = "index.html">Poker Hand Probability</a></h2>
      <p>
        I wrote a program in java that allows the user to run x number of iterations of random
        hands. It then follows an algorithm to find the best play from that hand (for example,
        if a hand was fully hearts, the code would return a value of flush (assuming that a 
        flush is the best play we can make from our hand)).
      </p>
      <h2><a href = "index.html">Image to ASCII</a></h2>
      <p>
        I wrote a program in python that allows the user to upload an image and changes a few settings
        (such as pixel width and inversion). The program then prints an ASCII image of the image uploaded.
      </p>
      <h2><a href = "index.html">Letterboxed</a></h2>
      <p>
        I wrote a program in java that emulates the
        <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed">
          Letterboxed game on the NYT website</a>.
        I also wrote an A* algorithm that solves the puzzle in the least amount of words/letters
        possible.
      </p>
      <h2><a href = "MarbleMazeWebBuild/marble.html">Marble Maze</a></h2>
      <p>
        I wrote this game in unity using C#. This was my first 3D games project. It's pretty simple but
        it was a fun project. I used depth first search to create a proceduraly generated maze.
